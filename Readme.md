# Text data of food products in the Japan Standard Commodity Classification published by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications

Currently, our laboratory is developing an ontology of Japanese foods. The ontology is being developed based 
on the food groups listed in the Appendix of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey published 
by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). However, the MIC page is a scanned image of the publication, 
not computer-processable text data. Some of the digital data can be found on e-stat and MHLW pages, but we did not think 
that data showing the full extent of the scanned images is publicly available. Therefore, we converted the scanned images of 
the publications to text data using the OCR function of Google Docs. I should have published the data in RDF/OWL, 
but we thought it might be useful for certain people even in this state, so I decided to make it public.
